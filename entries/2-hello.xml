<title>Welcome</title>
<text>Drukkar is a small blogging software program and CMS made with the following in mind:

* minimum page overhead &amp;mdash; the content should account for most of your web
traffic
* working without a database 
* ease of releasing files with your posts

Each blog entry (post) is stored as a separate XML file in a directory. The clean, compact and correct HTML 4.01 Strict that Drukkar generates is well-suited for projects accessed over slow connections like GSM networks, modems or Tor. 

Example uses of the file posting feature include:

* a game developer posting alpha versions of his or her game
* a government organization releasing forms and other documentation to the public — this is what Drukkar was initially developed for

The fact that Drukkar uses XML files to store its blog entries and configuration is either a big strength or a weakness depending on your needs. It is easy to set up on any server with PHP 5, including in a  user's `public_html` directory, however, Drukkar may not easily scale beyond a certain number of hits per day without external caching.

**Visit our [SourceForge project page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/drukkar/) for downloads** and contacts, **[browse the code on GitHub](https://github.com/dbohdan/drukkar)** or **read the manual below** to get a taste of what it is like to work with Drukkar. This blog is powered by Drukkar.

The name &quot;Drukkar&quot; is a play on Ukrainian &quot;друкар&quot;, meaning &quot;printer&quot; (the profession, not the peripheral).</text>
